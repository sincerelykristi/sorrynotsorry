[Go play #SorryNotSorry](https://sincerelykristi.github.io/sorrynotsorry/)

**User Story:** This game targets our delight in nostalgia as well as our innundation with current culture, which today is often dictated by the internet and memes or fads that arise there. #SorryNotSorry's user is likely a Millenial or Gen Xer who is looking to kill time on the internet with a fun game that is familiar and comforting but also new and timely.

**MVP:** The MVP of this game will be a board that 8 pieces (or pegs), 4 for the user and 4 for the computer opponent, travel around. The first of the two different players (user and computer) to make all 4 of their pegs to the finish will win. 

*I was able to go one step beyond my MVP and include testing for if a peg lands where an opposing peg is currently, it will send that peg home to start over, adding some strategy for the user.*

**Wireframes:**

**Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery were used in making this game. 
The game board itself and the pegs were created simply with HTML and CSS and then Javascript and
JQuery were used to implement game logic and DOM Manipulation.

**Unsolved problems:** There are still a few bugs left unsolved. First, when the computer wins it
occasionally will not stop the game and return the You Lose! message. 

Also, often when the user's peg moves just one from Home to land on the start, it will return a message saying that you have send a blue peg home, even though one was not there.

Lastly, If you go to the game then back to Instructions, the 'Draw Card' button stays.
